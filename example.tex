\begin{frabstract}
        This file aims to provide an overview of the \FRverb{pet-final-report}
        class and its functionalities. The class file is modified from my own
        final report, and therefore is influenced by my own personal taste.
        It is assumed that you have installed \FRverb{texlive-all}.

        As stated within the class file, this class is licenced under CC0
        and is therefore public domain. This is to prevent any issues with
        others trying to use it with their own final reports.

        The University of York logo \& shield included within this project are
        the property of the University of York.
